Projects have been run with:
./simulation -f filename.txt -a algorithmname -m memorysize > temporaryfile.out

The first three test cases are run with fcfs and memory sizes 100/100/25
The remaining seven test cases are run with multi and memory sizes 100/150/160/400/100/16384/1000

The temporaryfile.out is then compared with the corresponding sameple output file with the diff command. Test cases are attached.
