# COMP30023 - Assignment 1
Assignment 1 for COMP30023 - Computer Systems, a scheduler and memory manager.

## Directory structure

The root directory has the code, including makefile, this readme, the spec and some bash scripts to run the test cases. It also contains the final report for part B.

- partA_cases contains all the input cases created for writing the initial project. These include the given test case, specInput (along with its appropriate output for the two algorithms) as well as additional tests for testing certain edge cases.
- partB_cases contains input cases and all other files relevant to part B, excluding the final report which is in the base directory.
- old_output contains everything else. This is all non-essential to the project and was made purely for initial diagnostic purposes while writing the code, including discarded test cases and half written code.
